# 2025-CSAS-Data-Challenge

### - Utilized Swing Data From the 2024 Season to Evaluate Different Swing Types.
### - Evaluated Different Situations Where Batters Would Change Their Swings Based on the Circumstances (Number of Strikes, Number of Outs, RISP, etc.) and Then Evaluated Whether These Changes were Advantageous.
### - Utilized KMeans Clustering to Classify Swing Types into Distinct Groups and then Created Run Expectancy Matrices for Each Cluster Based on Number of Outs and Base Situation.
### - Created an XGBoost Model That Predicted Delta Win Expectancy Based on Cluster, Outs, Base Situation, Inning, Score Difference, and Count.
### - Found That Having Different Swing Types Can Be Beneficial in Maxmizing Offense, with Fast Swings Maxmizing Total Run Expectancy While More Controlled Swings are Beneficial for Getting At Least 1 Run Home.
